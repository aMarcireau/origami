## Themes

To change the color theme, edit the *colors.json* file with the path:
- *Origami/resources/app/colors.json* under Linux
- *Origami.app/Contents/Resources/app/colors.json* under macOS (right-cick on the app and choose *Show Package Contents*)
- *Origami\resources\app\colors.json* under Windows

The *themes* directory of this repository contains several themes suggestions.

## Formats

### Multiple DOIs import

Origami can load several DOIs at once from a [JSON](https://www.json.org) formated file with the following structure:
```yaml
[
    "10.1109/biorob.2016.7523449",
    "10.3389/fnins.2017.00350",
    "10.3389/fnins.2017.00535",
    "10.1109/tbcas.2017.2759700",
    "10.3389/fnins.2016.00594",
    "10.1007/s11263-017-1050-6"
]
```

### Saves

Origami saves and load collections in [JSON](https://www.json.org) format. The generated files have the following structure:
```yaml
{
    "appVersion": "0.10.0", # the version of the app used to generate this save
    "display": 0,           # the current display's index (0 for graph, 1 for list)

## Contribute

### Install

Origami is build with [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org).

Follow these steps to download the source code, edit and build Origami:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
2. Clone the repository by running from a terminal `git clone https://github.com/aMarcireau/origami.git`.
3. Go to the created *origami* folder and run `npm install`.

For development, run from the *origami* folder the command `npm run-script watch`. It will trigger a development build whenever something from the *souce* directory changes.

In order to create a new release, run:
1. `npm run-script build` to generate production builds for each supported platform.
2. `npm run-script release` to create a new Github release (requires administration rights on this repository).

The code documentation is held in the [Wiki](https://github.com/aMarcireau/origami/wiki).
